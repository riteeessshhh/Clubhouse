Live Project Link - https://clubhouse-nine.vercel.app/

In this clubhouse, users can log in to view messages, but the catch is they won’t know who posted them or when.
To access more features, users can become members by answering a riddle correctly. 
As members, they can see all messages, who posted them, and even add their own messages.
But there’s more! Members can also level up to admins by answering another riddle. 
Admins can see all users of the app, delete messages, and enjoy all the member privileges.

For this project, I used Express.js for the backend, MongoDB as the database, and EJS for server-side rendering.
I really enjoyed making this :)
